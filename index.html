            <p>noobWarrior is a work-in-progress free (as in freedom) program that emulates Roblox's online features so that you can play Roblox games and engage in their thriving communities on an independent platform.</p>
            <p>It is also focused on helping developers preserve their Roblox games (or experiences as they call it.)</p>
            <p>noobWarrior tries its best to not bundle in any copyrighted works by the Roblox Corporation. The program itself comes with no Roblox items or binaries of the game engine.</p> <!-- comment this out because it's not true yet However, the Roblox CoreGui scripts are included because they are licensed under a permissive license to my knowledge.</p> -->

            <h2>Where can I find a download?</h2>
            <p>There isn't a download yet. Read the red banner at the top.</p>

            <h2>How can I help you?</h2>
            <p>I'm currently looking for volunteers who possess some degree of C++ knowledge and have the same amount of interest that I have to work on this. If that's the case then contact me through <a href="mailto:contact@noobwarrior.org">contact@noobwarrior.org</a> and we'll talk.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can contact me on Discord through <a>@hattozo</a>. Or you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/noobwarrior-org/noobwarrior">git repo</a> and explore the codebase. Send a PR if you think anything is off.</p>
