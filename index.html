            <p>noobWarrior is a work-in-progress free (as in freedom) program that emulates Roblox's online features so that you can play Roblox games and engage in their thriving communities on an independent platform.</p>
            <p>It is also focused on helping developers preserve their Roblox games (or experiences as they call it.)</p>
            <p>The philosophy of noobWarrior is simple: we want people to be able to play these games for decades without the Roblox company potentially introducing devastating game-breaking changes. Millions of people hold these games dear to their hearts, and butchering it all with little explanation or recourse is simply unacceptable to us. We want to give developers and players the tools they need to do their thing without this sort of behavior.</p>
            <p>noobWarrior tries its best to not bundle in any copyrighted works by the Roblox Corporation. The program itself comes with no Roblox items or binaries of the game engine.</p> <!-- comment this out because it's not true yet However, the Roblox CoreGui scripts are included because they are licensed under a permissive license to my knowledge.</p> -->

            <h2>Where can I find a download?</h2>
            <p>There isn't a download yet. Read the red banner at the top.</p>

            <h2>How can I help you?</h2>
            <p>I'm currently looking for volunteers who possess some degree of C++ knowledge and have the same amount of interest that I have to work on this. If that's the case then contact me on Discord at <a>@hattozo</a> and we'll talk. I don't have a forum or professional email for development or anything like that, I'm just getting this off the ground so that's why I'm relying on Discord for now.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, check out the <a href="https://github.com/noobwarrior-org/noobwarrior">git repo</a> and explore the codebase. Send a PR if you think anything is off.</p>
